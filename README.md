A simple temperature converter website allows users to convert temperatures from one unit to another. It typically has an input field for the user to enter the temperature in a particular unit (such as Celsius or Fahrenheit), and buttons or radio buttons to select the desired output unit (such as Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin).
The website is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
